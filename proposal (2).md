# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Hangman

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Its a singleplayer game of hangman where the player is always the one guessing the word. The player has a certain amount of incorrect guesses before they lose.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will start by picking a random word and telling the player how many letters are in the word. The player will then be prompted with an input to put in a letter. The program will check if the letter is in the chosen word, and tell the player whether it is wrong or right. If wrong, it will tally up one error, and add the incorrect letter to a letter bank of incorrectly guessed letters. If right, the program will redisplay the word with the all correctly guess letters filled in, and all unguessed letters displayed as underscores. This will repeat until the player reaches a certain amount of wrong guesses, or the entire word is guessed.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my project is that I can get the game itself working, where the player guess the word and they can win and lose. The game will keep track of the players progess as they guess.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want to combine the text window game with an image window, so I can make the interface of the game much more interesting. The letter bank and guess word will be constantly displaced and updated instead of being re-printed after every prompt in the text window

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope I can get the project so that everything is drawn with a turtle, so I can draw the hangman as the player guesses wrong

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My first step is to do a lot more research on strings. The hardest part of the project will be getting the actual game working. After I get the basic game working, I will start working on the additional features. The additional features will be used with much easier functions, but there will be a lot to do.
